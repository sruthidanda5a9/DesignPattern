Till now we did simple strategy pattern to add behaviour to ducks.
so our main method considers only the quackable ducks.
but we have horse near us. an dis willing to join the group. 
To addpt horse to duck we need to use adapter pattern.


But we would like to count the number f ducks.
so we need to add decorater to count the number of ducks.

till now we are adding decorations to count the number of ducks everything fine but if we forgot to add
that decoartion tha will be mess. Why to do that with our hand.
lets use factory pattern to create the objects and add decoarations for us.

Till now everything going great but we have plenty of ducks then why are you creating them manulaly and each everytime you are calling
quck method of that.

even though you encapsulated the quakc call . its bettre to use compisit pattern to
avoid too many quck calls.
